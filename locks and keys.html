        <br> These cool metal 3D printing applications make your door safer! Using this technology, you can 3D print unique high-security cylinder locks and keys. That’s precisely what UrbanAlps, a Swiss company did. They mass produce locks and keys, but they’re all different one from another. The main benefit of these keys is that they are extremely hard to reproduce, thus highly secure. How come? Most of the mechanical security features are hidden inside of the key, which makes it impossible to scan.

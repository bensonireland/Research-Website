    <br> The Tour de France is a major cycling event which takes place each year, and that can sometimes be seen as a bit old school. But that would be a mistake to judge it in this way: innovation is coming! Indeed, Pinarello, an Italian company, has used metal 3D printing to create a unique handlebar design for two cyclists: Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas. Metal 3D printing has been chosen since it allowed to create custom-made designs, with cost and lead time reduction. And it worked! Geraint Thomas won the first race of the event.

        <br> Sonova, a Swiss company, started using 3D printing to create custom-made hearing aids, using Acrylic. How do they make it? First, they take an impression of the patient’s ear canal by hand, using silicon. Then, the mold is 3D scanned and turned into a 3D model. They recently succeeded in creating Virto B-Titanium devices, which fit better the patient’s ear and are more resistant. Indeed, hearing aids made with this material are 15 times stronger than Acrylic ones. Moreover, the device is 26% smaller than the average products on the market, being approximately the size of a fingertip, and remaining as performant as other hearing aids.
